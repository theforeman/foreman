Quick help:

Users and developers
--------------------

If you do not see translations in the production mode, run either

  # rake gettext:pack

or

  # make -C locale all-mo

to generate translation binary MO files and restart.

Developers
----------

To re-extract strings from codebase and model into POT/PO files, make sure you
have up-to-date model (best is to start with clean database) and extract via
rake task:

  # rake db:migrate
  # rake db:seed
  # rake locale:find

Please do not use gettext:pack directly as we do additional postprocessing.
