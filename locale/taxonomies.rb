# Taxonomies is a generic impl used for both locations and organizations which
# uses Rails' inflector to get variations on the controller name (singular,
# plural etc).  This file contains the equivalent strings for i18n extraction.

# Singular, lower case (taxonomy_single)
_("location")
_("organization")

# Singular, titleized (taxonomy_title)
_("Location")
_("Organization")

# Plural, titleized (taxonomy_upcase)
_("Locations")
_("Organizations")
