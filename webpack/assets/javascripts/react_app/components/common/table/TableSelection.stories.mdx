# Table With Select boxes

All needed functions and components are located at: `/react_app/components/common/table/index.js`
To add select boxes to your foreman table please follow this steps:

## Connect The reducer
Create a unique reducer for your table by calling the `selectionReducer(tableID)` from the table folder to your component.
**tableID** - a string that will represents the table in the store and will be used in the actions

<Icon type="pf" name="info" />
{' '}Tip: You can connect a few reducers to one component using Redux's
<strong> combineReducers</strong>

## Connect The Actions

Create a `selectionController` using the `getSelectionController` helper

```js
getSelectionController({
  tableID,
  allRowsSelected,
  rows,
  selectedRows,
  dispatch,
});
```

You will need to provide the function the following argumets:
**tableID**: a string that will represents the table in the store
**allRowsSelected**: a boolean that describes if all the rows available are selected.
This boolean is provided by the selection reducer and should be in the components store
**rows**: an array of row object that are available in the current page of the table. Each object should have an id.
**selectedRows**: an array of the selected ids (if all rows are selected this can be empty) This array is provided by the selection reducer and should be in the components store.
**dispatch**: dispatch function from the Redux store.
Can be created using the useDispatch() hook.
This is used for the selction actions.

## Add To The Table TableScheme

In the table schema array add the following item:

```js
    column(
      '', // property
      'Select all rows', // label
      [label => selectionHeaderCellFormatter(selectionController, label)], // headFormat
      [
        (value, additionalData) =>
          selectionCellFormatter(selectionController, additionalData),
      ] // cellFormat
    ),
```

The `property` is not used in the formatter so it should be empty.
The `label` will be user for the tooltip information (title property) and aria-label.

### Data provided by the reducer

**allRowsSelected**: a boolean that describes if all the rows available are selected
**selectedRows**: an array of the selected ids
**showSelectAll**: a boolean that indicates should the select all option be available?
This is true after a user is selection the whole page. Use this to show a select all button or message box.

### Additional Actions

If you want to use the selection action for uses outside the table you can use import selection actions from the table folder.
Available actions:

```js
selectPage(tableID, rows);
selectAllRows(tableID);
unselectAllRows(tableID);
selectRow(tableID, id);
unselectRow(tableID, id, rows);
```
