# ForemanContext

ForemanContext is an implementation of the new `React Context` API.
Global metadata (such as version, pagination, theme, foreman's settings, etc...) can be shared over all react nodes
without any redux integration nor API request.

### How to apply it

`Foreman Context` comes with every react component by default, like redux's store.

### How to read a value

#### With Hooks
Like selectors, you can consume context values by custom hooks:

```js
// ....
import {
  useForemanSettings,
  useForemanVersion,
} from '../../Root/Context/ForemanContext';

const { perPage } = useForemanSettings();
const foremanVersion = useForemanVersion();
```

### How to add a value to the context

Keys and values are set in the `app_metadata` method of `/application_helper.rb`.
The `app_metadata` object is passed down and becomes ForemanContext.

If you add a new value to `app_metadata`, it will also be useful to add a new custom hook in `webpack/assets/javascripts/react_app/ReactApp/Context/ForemanContext.js`
so that the value can be easily consumed on the front end.
For example, Adding a new hook:
```js
// Context/ForemanContext.js

export const useForemanFeature = () => useForemanContext().feature;
```
