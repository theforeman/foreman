# Internationalization

All strings need to be translated.

### Foreman core

`import I18n.js` which located in `/webpack/assets/javascripts/react_app/common`

```js
import {
  sprintf,
  translate as __,
  ngettext as n_,
} from '../react_app/common/I18n';

// - Sets the key to translate
const str = __('a string');

// - Plural version of translate
const num_toasters = 2;
const plural_str = n_(
  'I have one toaster.',
  'I have %1$d toasters.',
  num_toasters
);
```

Use the `__` and `n_` aliasing, it is necessary for the string extration process

### Plugins

Same as foreman core, just use `foremanReact` alias:

```js
import {
  sprintf,
  translate as __,
  ngettext as n_,
} from 'foremanReact/common/I18n';
```

## Interpolation

Make sure that the strings inside the underscore function don't contain any interpolated values.
Using interpolation would break the actual translation of the string in runtime. Use `sprintf` from `I18n` instead.

**Example:**

```js
// Wrong:
let msg = __(`%{taskCount} tasks complete`);
```

```js
// Correct:
import { sprintf } from '../react_app/common/I18n';
let msg = sprintf(__('%(taskCount)s tasks complete'), { taskCount });
```

**Please note that the global underscore, sprintf and ngettext are deprecated**.
