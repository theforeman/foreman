# Plugins

## Using components from Foreman core

There are three ways components provided by Foreman core can be re-used:

### 1. Mounting components into ERB

No special setup is required and you can re-use React components that are available in `componentRegistry` even when your plugin doesn't use Webpack.
Components can be mounted into ERB using the `react_component` helper:

```ruby
react_component(component_name, props)
```

**Example:**

```erb
<%= react_component('PowerStatus', id: host.id, url: power_host_path(host.id)) %>
```

will render the following HTML:

```html
<react-component
  name="PowerStatus"
  data-props="<%= {
    id: host.id,
    url: power_host_path(host.id)
  }.to_json %>"
></react-component>
```

(Note that the React component is rendered as a [web component](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components).)

The list of available components is [here](https://github.com/theforeman/foreman/blob/develop/webpack/assets/javascripts/react_app/components/componentRegistry.js#L60).

### 2. Re-using core code in Webpack

If your plugin uses Webpack, you can import and the core functionality from `foremanReact`.

**Example:**

```js
// import helpers from foremanReact:
import { noop } from 'foremanReact/common/helpers';

// import components from foremanReact:
import { MessageBox } from 'foremanReact/components/common/MessageBox';
```

### 3. Using components outside of Webpack

The component registry is available in `Window.tfm.componentRegistry`. That gives you access to the components even from js code that isn't processed by Webpack.

```js
const MyComponent = Window.tfm.componentRegistry.getComponent(componentName)
  .type;
```

Most of the components must be wrapped with a [Higher-Order Component](https://reactjs.org/docs/higher-order-components.html) that provides some context like Redux store or Intl. `componentRegistry` publishes a wrapper factory that can create a wrapper function with HOCs according to your needs.

```js
const i18nWrapper = componentRegistry.wrapperFactory().with('i18n').wrapper;
const MyComponentWithIntl = i18nWrapper(MyComponent);
```

# Using Webpack in plugins

There are 3 conditions that a plugin has to fulfill to share the Webpack infrastructure from Foreman core:

- A `./webpack/` folder containing all the Webpack-processed code
- A `package.json` file with dependencies
- A defined main entry point in `package.json` or just have `./webpack/index.js`

The Webpack config is shared with core, so there's no need for custom configuration.

Once all the above is set up, then the script `npm run install` executed from root of the core's git checkout installs dependencies for plugins too.
Also `npm run lint` and `npm run test` behaves similarly.

### Entry points

The Webpack config respects the main entry point defined in `package.json`. On top of that it loads all files matching `./webpack/*index.js`. That allows plugins to define multiple independent entry points. This can be useful in special use-cases. For example when you need to mix some parts of Webpack-processed code into pages that use asset pipeline only.

### Troubleshooting

You can make sure Webpack knows about your plugin by executing script `plugin_webpack_directories.rb` that prints json-formatted info about all recognized plugins.

```bash
> ./script/plugin_webpack_directories.rb | json_reformat
{
    "entries": {
        "katello": "/home/vagrant/foreman/katello/webpack/index.js"
    },
    "paths": [
        "/home/vagrant/foreman/katello/webpack"
    ],
    "plugins": {
        "katello": {
            "root": "/home/vagrant/foreman/katello",
            "entry": "/home/vagrant/foreman/katello/webpack/index.js"
        }
    }
}
```
