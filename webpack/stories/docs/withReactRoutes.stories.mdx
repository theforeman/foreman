# withReactRoutes

`withReactRoutes` wrapps your component with `Router` which gives you access to the react-router. This is useful for components in erb pages that need access to client routing - a good example is a button that redirects to a page in React:

```js
import { Link } from 'react-router-dom';

import withReactRoutes from './react_app/common/withReactRoutes';

const LinkButton = props => (
  <Link to={props.path}>
    <Button>{props.text}</Button>
  </Link>
);

export default withReactRoutes(LinkButton);
```
