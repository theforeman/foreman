# API Middleware

Instead of each component handling API calls in the same way we have the API Middleware that will handle it.

`APIActions` can be imported from 'webpack/assets/javascripts/react_app/redux/API/index.js'
or 'foremanReact/redux/API/index.js' for plugins

`APIActions` contains the following methods: `get`, `post`, `put`, `delete`, `patch` which can be also imported independently, e.g:

```js
import { get, post, put, patch } from '../../redux/API';
// can't import 'delete' as it's a reserved word in JS.
```

## How to use it in your action

```js
import { get } from '../../redux/API';

const someAction = url =>
  get({
    key: MY_SPECIAL_KEY, // this will be used later to identify your API call, so keep it unique.
    url,
    params: {}, // some params you will want to pass to the API request.
    headers: {}, // some headers you will want to pass to the API request.
  });
```

or

```js
dispatch(
  get({
    key: MY_SPECIAL_KEY, // this will be used later to identify your API call, so keep it unique.
    url,
    params: {}, // some params you will want to pass to the API request.
    headers: {}, // some headers you will want to pass to the API request.
  })
);
```

Then there will be called 2 actions: **MY_SPECIAL_KEY_REQUEST** and **MY_SPECIAL_KEY_SUCCESS/ MY_SPECIAL_KEY_FAILURE**:
**MY_SPECIAL_KEY_REQUEST** will have the payload only
**MY_SPECIAL_KEY_SUCCESS** will have the payload and the return data from the API call.
**MY_SPECIAL_KEY_FAILURE** will have the payload and the return error from the API call.

In the **payload** field you should send any headers and params for the GET request, and any other data you want for the action.

The actions types can be changed with the optional **actionTypes** parameter:

```js
dispatch(
  get({
    key: MY_SPECIAL_KEY, // this will be used later to identify your API call, so keep it unique.
    url,
    params: {} // some params you will want to pass to the API request.
    headers: {}, // some headers you will want to pass to the API request.
    actionTypes: {
      REQUEST: 'CUSTOM_REQUEST',
      SUCCESS: 'CUSTOM_SUCCESS',
      FAILURE: 'CUSTOM_FAILURE',
    },
  })
);
```

## Main API Reducer

The API will manage the request lifecycle in the redux store > API > the provided key, e.g:

```js
{
  API: {
    MY_COMPONENT_KEY: { // this is the key you provided in the API action.
      status: 'RESOLVED',
      payload, // the payload you passed to the API action
      response, // the API response. it will store data on success or error on failure.
    }
  }
}
```

it will manage the request statuses, errors and responses.

### Access the API store

We provided you the `selectAPIByKey` in '/APISelectors.js' which will return the key substate,
there are also `selectAPIStatus`, `selectAPIPayload`, `selectAPIResponse`, `selectAPIError` and `selectAPIErrorMessage`.

## Error handling

In case you want to invoke some method or action immediately when an error occurs,
we support the `handleError` param where you could pass an error handling function, e.g:

```js
dispatch(
  get({
    key: MY_SPECIAL_KEY,
    url,
    handleError: error => error.response.status === 401 ? logoutUser() : null
    ...
  })
);
```

The error handling function will receive the error object from the API request.

## Success handling

In case you want to invoke some method or action immediately after the request succeed,
we support the `handleSuccess` param where you could pass a success handling function, e.g:

```js
dispatch(
  get({
    key: MY_SPECIAL_KEY,
    url,
    handleSuccess: response => { dispatch(addToast({ type: 'success' })) },
    ...
  })
);
```

The success handling function will receive the response object from the API request.

## Toast handling

Instead of managing and dispatching the toast action by yourself, you can use the API middleware shortcuts,
by passing `toastSuccess` or `toastError` as keys in the API action, e.g:

```js
dispatch(
  get({
    key: MY_SPECIAL_KEY,
    url,
    toastError: error => `Oh no! Something went wrong while submiting the form, the server returned the following error: ${error}`
    toastSuccess: response => `Yay! task: ${response.taskID} was successfully created.`
  })
);
```
