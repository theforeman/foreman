# Connected React Router
Foreman uses react-router for client routing in react pages, however foreman contains lots of erb content which includes react components.
in order to control react router better and to have one source of truth,
foreman uses `connected-react-router` which enable controling react router via redux.

### Push url
This pushed a new url (including querystring) to react router and creates a transition

```js
import { pushUrl } from '../foreman_navigation';

<Button onClick={() => pushUrl('/hosts')}>
   Click Me!
</Button>
```

### React Router Selectors
You can use react router selectors for retriving data

selectRouterLocation - the current location.
electRouterPath - the current path
selectRouterSearch - the current search
selectRouterHash  - the current hash
selectRouter - the entire router object which includes every entry above

```js
import { useSelector } from 'react-redux';
import { selectRouterLocation } from '../routes/RouterSelector';


const location = useSelector(selectRouterLocation);
```
