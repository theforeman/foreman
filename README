Generally, you need the following things installed:

* Puppet
* rake >= 0.84

to get latest working branch (which is the only one really valid at this point of time do:

git clone git://github.com/ohadlevy/gni.git gni
cd gni
git checkout -b origin/ohad
git submodule update --init

if you want to share the database with Puppets (storeconfig) edit config/database.yml and configure the production database to point to the same database, if not, you can use any other database rails support.

type:
RAILS_ENV=production rake db:migrate
./script/server -e production

the following URLs might be intersting:
http://localhost:3000/ for really basic webgui
http://localhost:3000/unattended/kickstart will return a kickstart file for the relevant machine
http://localhost:3000/hosts/externalNodes?fqdn=<host fqdn> will retun a yaml output for puppet to use.

If you are currently using Store Configs with Puppet and would like your Operating Systems and Environment populated from your puppet DB you can use the following Rake Tasks:

rake puppet:migrate:populate_hosts                       # Migrate your puppet based hosts information to GNI
