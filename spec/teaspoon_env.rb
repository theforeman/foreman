  # SUITES

  # You can modify the default suite configuration and create new suites here. Suites are isolated from one another.

  # When defining a suite you can provide a name and a block. If the name is left blank, :default is assumed. You can
  # omit various directives and the ones defined in the default suite will be used.
  #

  # - with the rake task: rake teaspoon suite=[suite_name]
  # - with the cli: teaspoon --suite=[suite_name]
