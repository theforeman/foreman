- message: ActionDispatch::Http::ParameterFilter is deprecated and will be removed
    from Rails 6.1. Use ActiveSupport::ParameterFilter instead.
- message: Class level methods will no longer inherit scoping from `create!` in Rails
    6.1. To continue using the scoped relation, pass it into the block directly. To
    instead access the full set of models, as Rails 6.1 will, use `Puppetclass.unscoped`,
    or `Puppetclass.default_scoped` if a model has default scopes.
- message: Initialization autoloaded the constants
- message: You are using a deprecated behavior, it will be removed in version 3.3, initial value of setting 'instance_id' should be created in a migration
