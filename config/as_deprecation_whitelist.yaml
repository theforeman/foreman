- message: ActionDispatch::Http::ParameterFilter is deprecated and will be removed
    from Rails 6.1. Use ActiveSupport::ParameterFilter instead.
- message: Class level methods will no longer inherit scoping from `create!` in Rails
    6.1. To continue using the scoped relation, pass it into the block directly. To
    instead access the full set of models, as Rails 6.1 will, use `Puppetclass.unscoped`,
    or `Puppetclass.default_scoped` if a model has default scopes.
- message: Controller-level `force_ssl` is deprecated and will be removed from Rails
    6.1. Please enable `config.force_ssl` in your environment configuration to enable
    the ActionDispatch::SSL middleware to more fully enforce that your application
    communicate over HTTPS. If needed, you can use `config.ssl_options` to exempt
    matching endpoints from being redirected to HTTPS.
- message: NOT conditions will no longer behave as NOR in Rails 6.1. To continue using
    NOR conditions, NOT each conditions manually (`.where.not(:compute_resource_id
    => ...).where.not(:uuid => ...)`).
- message: Rails 6.1 will return Content-Type header without modification. If you
    want just the MIME type, please use `#media_type` instead.
- message: "`.represent_boolean_as_integer=` is now always true, so setting this is
    deprecated and will be removed in Rails 6.1."
- message: "`Module#parent` has been renamed to `module_parent`. `parent` is deprecated
    and will be removed in Rails 6.1."
- message: Initialization autoloaded the constants
