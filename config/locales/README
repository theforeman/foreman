Foreman Rails i18n
------------------

Do not commit into this directory directly!

Prepare pull request for the upstream:

https://github.com/svenfuchs/rails-i18n

Make sure the requests gets into proper branches (rails-3-x, rails-4-x...)
and use ./update.sh script to pull new translations here.

The script only updates existing languages. To add a new language just
create an empty file and run update script:

  # touch de.yml
  # ./update.sh

To see how many translations are not localized for each language locally
and upstream, use ./show-missing.sh script.

Translations are licensed under MIT license.
