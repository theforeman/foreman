# Configuration values can be set per environment and apply to the root logger that
# all other loggers inherit from. Additional loggers can be configured in settings.yaml
# The valid options are:
#
# :colorize:
#   Colorize log including level token based on severity
#   values: true, false
#
# :console_inline:
#   Enable logging output inline in rails console
#   values: true, false
#
# :level:
#   Only messages with severity >= this level from all loggers will be logged
#   values: debug, info, warn, error, fatal, unknown
#
# :type:
#   Type of logging, for file variant you can specify other options below like filename
#   values: file, stdout, syslog or journald
#
# :filename:
#   Log filename for this environment, it will be placed into #{Rails.root}/log directory
#   note when you log outside of standard rails path you won't see log output in WEBrick
#   STDOUT (usually not wanted in development), to use Rails default path, don't set path
#
# :truncate:
#   Truncate the log file to a zero byte length on each startup to reduce size, only
#   supported with type: file
#   values: true, false (default)
#
# :log_trace:
#   Include caller tracing information in generated log events (this
#   includes filename and line number of the log message)
#   values: true, false
#
# :layout:
#   Formatter, one of 'pattern', 'multiline_pattern', 'multiline_request_pattern' or 'json'. The multiline pattern prepends
#   '|' characters on all additional lines for better readability. The multiline request pattern also adds request id to
#   all additional line for better log searching.
#
# :json_items:
#   Items to include in JSON. Only applies when 'json' layout is set. Possible items are
#   logger timestamp level message file line method hostname pid millis thread_id thread
#   mdc ndc. Global fields like session or organization are available under 'mdc' item,
#   local fields like exception class or backtrace are under 'ndc' item.
#
# :pattern:
#   Logger line pattern, currently ignored by syslog. You can use the following macros
#     [%c] name of the logger that generate the log event
#     [%d] datestamp
#     [%m] the user supplied log message
#     [%p] PID of the current process
#     [%r] the time in milliseconds since the program started
#     [%T] the name of the thread Thread.current[:name]
#     [%t] object_id of the thread
#     [%F] filename where the logging request was issued
#     [%L] line number where the logging request was issued
#     [%M] method name where the logging request was issued
#     [%X{request}] request-ID set in HTTP headers, or random UUID
#     [%X{session}] random ID assigned per session (not available for the initial log line by Rails)
#     [%X{user_login}] currently logged user if present
#     [%X{org_id}] current organization id if available
#     [%X{loc_id}] current location id if available
#     [%X{remote_ip}] remote IP
#     [%x{exception_class}] exception info (only for exception entries)
#     [%x{exception_message}] exception info (only for exception entries)
#     [%x{exception_backtrace}] exception info (only for exception entries)
#     [%X{string}] generic field set via MDC (::Logging.mdc['string'])
#     [%x{string}] generic field set via NDC (::Logging.ndc['string'])
#
# :sys_pattern:
#   Logger line pattern for system log/journal. See :pattern for more info.
#
# :facility:
#   System log/journal facility to use. One of LOG_AUTH, LOG_AUTHPRIV, LOG_CONSOLE,
#   LOG_CRON, LOG_DAEMON, LOG_FTP, LOG_KERN, LOG_LPR, LOG_MAIL, LOG_NEWS, LOG_NTP,
#   LOG_SECURITY, LOG_SYSLOG, LOG_USER, LOG_UUCP, LOG_LOCAL0 to LOG_LOCAL7. See
#   syslog(3) man page for more info.
