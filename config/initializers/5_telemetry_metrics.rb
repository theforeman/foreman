# Foreman telemetry metrics registration.
#
# There are three types of telemetry measurements: counter, gauge, histogram. Each measurement has unique name
# represented by a symbol, a description and list of tags which are required and mapped to monitoring frameworks
# which do not support arbitrary tags.
#
# Plugins can add own metrics through add_counter_telemetry, add_gauge_telemetry and add_histogram_telemetry.
#
