NAME
----
foreman-debug - Foreman configuration and log collector

SYNOPSIS
--------
foreman-debug [OPTIONS]

foreman-debug -d /output/dir -a -m 9000 -v

foreman-debug -h

DESCRIPTION
-----------

Collects configuration and log data for Foreman, Smart Proxies, backend
services and system information while removing security information like
passwords, tokens and keys.

This program can be used on Foreman instances, Smart Proxy instances or
backend services separately.

SENDING INFORMATION
-------------------

Use the *foreman-debug* tool to generate a tarball with your configuration and
recent logs and send it to developers for further investigation. Note that
passwords and tokens are filtered out, but the tarball still can contain
*sensitive information*. For this reason it is recommended to send directly to
the developers, and not publicly on the mailing list for production instances.

OPTIONS
-------

The following options are available:

  -d DIR  Directory to place the tarball in (default /tmp/foreman-XYZ)
  -g      Skip generic info (CPU, memory, firewall etc.)
  -a      Do not generate a tarball from the resulting directory
  -m NUM  Maximum lines to keep for each file (default 5000)
  -j PRG  Filter with provided program when creating a tarball
  -p      Additionally print all passwords which are being filtered
  -q      Quiet mode
  -v      Verbose mode
  -h      Shows this message
