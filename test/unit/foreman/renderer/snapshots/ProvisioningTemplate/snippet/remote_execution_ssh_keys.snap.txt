# SSH keys setup snippet for Remote Execution plugin
#
# Parameters:
#
# remote_execution_ssh_keys: public keys to be put in ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
#
# remote_execution_ssh_user: user for which remote_execution_ssh_keys will be
#                            authorized
#
# remote_execution_create_user: create user if it not already existing
#
# remote_execution_effective_user_method: method to switch from ssh user to
#                                         effective user
#
# This template sets up SSH keys in any host so that as long as your public
# SSH key is in remote_execution_ssh_keys, you can SSH into a host. This 
# works in combination with Remote Execution plugin by querying smart proxies
# to build an array.
#
# To use this snippet without the plugin provide the SSH keys as host parameter
# remote_execution_ssh_keys. It expects the same format like the authorized_keys
# file.
