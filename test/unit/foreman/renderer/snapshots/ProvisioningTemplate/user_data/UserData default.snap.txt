  # SSH keys setup snippet for Remote Execution plugin
  #
  # Parameters:
  #
  # remote_execution_ssh_keys: public keys to be put in ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
  #
  # remote_execution_ssh_user: user for which remote_execution_ssh_keys will be
  #                            authorized
  #
  # remote_execution_create_user: create user if it not already existing
  #
  # remote_execution_effective_user_method: method to switch from ssh user to
  #                                         effective user
  #
  # This template sets up SSH keys in any host so that as long as your public
  # SSH key is in remote_execution_ssh_keys, you can SSH into a host. This
  # works in combination with Remote Execution plugin by querying smart proxies
  # to build an array.
  #
  # To use this snippet without the plugin provide the SSH keys as host parameter
  # remote_execution_ssh_keys. It expects the same format like the authorized_keys
  # file.
