  A medium represents the source of one or more operating system's installation files, accessible via the network.
  It will probably be a mirror from the internet or a copy of one or more CD or DVDs.
  </p>
  <p>
  For example, if you have copied several redhat release disks into a directory structure where the disk images are named 5.8 or 6.2, and each contained both x86_64 and i386 binaries, then you
  could create a single medium entry describing them all.
  The entry, which could be just named "redhat" could contain a path like this <em>"http://server/redhat/$version/$arch"</em>
  </p>
  <p>
  <span class="label label-info">Notice</span> The keywords <b>$version</b>, <b>$major</b> and <b>$minor</b> will be interpolated back into the path specification to calculate the true URL address.
  </p>
  <p>
  You may also associate one or more operating systems with this medium or alternatively set this up later on the <%= link_to "Operating systems", operatingsystems_path -%> page.
