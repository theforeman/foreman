  This is a placeholder template that must be replaced with the actual template
  that renders the POAP script. DHCP options must be configured to point NX-OS to
  download the POAP from Foreman. For more details, see https://projects.theforeman.org/issues/10526

# This template file is only a placeholder. Cisco provides sample Python
# scripts for POAP, but they are only distributed through their support site.
# You will need to provide your own POAP scripts or download one from Cisco.
