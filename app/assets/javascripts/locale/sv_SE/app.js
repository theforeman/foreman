Note that the default templates that are provided with the installation are also a good source of ERB syntax examples.":[""],"Embedded Ruby (ERB) is a tool for generating text files based on templates that combine plain text with Ruby code. Foreman uses ERB syntax in the following cases:":[""],"Provisioning templates":["Provisineringsmallar"],"Templates for partition tables":[""],"Report templates":[""],"Parameters":["Parametrar"],"Remote execution job templates":[""],"When the system asks for evaluated template, the code in the ERB tags is executed and the variables are replaced with their current values. This process is referred to as rendering. Typically rendering occurs during provisioning, when Kickstart file is asked by Anaconda or partition table is about to be deployed. Rendering also happens when a Remote Execution job is triggered to render the script to be executed. While the ERB exposes the power of programming language executed on the application server, the rendering mechanism has the safemode rendering option enabled by default, which prevents any harmful code being executed from templates.":[""],"Each template type rendering capabilities slightly differ, e.g. a provisioning template is always rendered for a single host object and therefore a @host variable is defined. Another example is a report template, where report formatting specific macros are available.":[""],"Writing ERB Templates":[""],"The following tags are the most important and commonly used in ERB templates":[""],"All Ruby code is enclosed within <code><&#37; &#37;></code> in an ERB template. The code is executed when the template is rendered. It can contain Ruby control flow structures as well as application-specific macros and variables. For example:":[""],"Note that there is no output from tags starting with <% when the template is rendered.":[""],"This provides the same functionality as <code><%</code> but when the template is executed, the code output is inserted into the template. This is useful for variable substitution, for example:":[""],"Note that words starting with <code>@</code> are instance variables. When the template is rendered, some instance variables are automatically predefined. Whether you can use a predefined variable depends on the template type, for example, the variable @host is available for the provisioning template, partition tables, and remote execution jobs.":[""],"Note that if you enter an incorrect instance variable, no output is returned. However, if you try to call a method on an incorrect variable, the following error message returns:":[""],"By default, a newline character is inserted after a Ruby block if it is closed at the end of a line:":[""],"To change the default behavior, modify the enclosing mark with <code>-&#37;></code>:":[""],"This is used to reduce the number of lines, where Ruby syntax permits, in rendered templates. White spaces in ERB tags are ignored.":[""],"The following example demonstrates how this is used to to remove unnecessary newlines between a FQDN and IP address:":[""],"Note the extra space before IP, the <code>-&#37;></code> removes the new line character only if there is no other text after it. Therefore the white space needs to be at the new line.":[""],"Encloses a comment that is ignored during template rendering:":[""],"This generates no output. However if the closing tag was <code>&#37;></code> without the dash, it would generate a new line":[""],"Because of the varying lengths of the ERB tags, indenting the ERB syntax might seem messy. ERB syntax ignores white space. One method of handling the indentation is to declare the ERB tag at the beginning of each new line and then use white space within the ERB tag to outline the relationships within the syntax, for example:":[""],"The Ruby code inside of the ERB tags typically contain expressions. They consist of program flow control terminals, variables, macros. Variables and macros evaluates to objects. Each object has set of allowed methods that can be called on it. These methods can return objects.":[""],"An example of a control flow terminal is an if condition or for each cycle. Macros are functions called by their name without specifying any object, e.g. %{load_hosts} or %{input}. See all available macros %{all_macros}. Example of object class is an %{integer}, String, %{host}, %{subnet}, %{user}. Calling a method on an object is denoted by <code>.</code>. For example <code>@host.fqdn</code> expression is an instance variable that holds and evaluates to an object of a Host, on which the fqdn method is called. To find the list of all available methods on objects, see the documentation for each template type.":[""],"here":["här"],"In the following example, <code>if</code> and <code>==</code> are terminals, <code>@host</code> is instance variable holding the object of the %{host_object_link} class, <code>.domain</code> is the call of the method named %{domain_method_link} on this %{host_object_link} object. That returns the %{domain_object_link} object. <code>.name</code> is then calling of a method %{name_method_link} on this %{domain_object_link} object. The resulting name of the domain is then compared with fixed string object example.com":[""],"In your templates, you might perform different actions depending on which value exists. To achieve this, you can use conditional statements in your ERB syntax.":[""],"In the following example, the ERB syntax searches for a specific host name and returns an output depending on the value it finds:":[""],"Note that the else branch is optional. Also multiple conditions can be specified using elsif, but that is usually better written using a case/when construct. See the example below":[""],"Note that the else branch is optional and can be omitted.":[""],"Sometimes it is necessary to iterate over arrays in order to retrieve the information. This is typically required in report templates when loaders are used, however the same technique is useful elsewhere too.":[""],"For example, this can be useful to configure all the Host NICs.":[""],"As you can see in the example above, the <code>interfaces</code> method on Host object returns a new object of type Collection. For simplicity, think of it as an array of all host interfaces. To process every item in this array, a method <code>each</code> is used.":[""],"This is the simple example of iterating over array of two interfaces and only printing the IP address of each. In reality, the interface object can be used to fetch more information, as shown in the following example. To see all available methods, see the documentation for %s object.":[""],"The information from above can be used e.g. to create a NetworkManager configuration file for each interface in the provisioning template.":[""],"In a report template, loader macros are used most of the time. Iterating over results of these is a little different. It is important to use <code>each_record</code> instead of <code>each</code>, because loaders load objects in batches and each record in fact represents the batch. Otherwise the construct looks the same, as shown in the following example":[""],"Templates can access built-in instance variables denoted by <code>@</code>.":[""],"Template":["Mall"],"Name of the template being rendered, \\\"Unnamed\\\" when the template does not have a name, e.g. preview on unsaved template.":[""],"\\\"preview\\\" or \\\"real\\\", this can be used to change the behavior for previewing the template":[""],"Represents the host object for which the template is rendered.":[""],"To customize a template for each individual rendering, various inputs can be defined.

A plain value can be specified as an arbitrary string, A search value allows the auto-completion in the UI, A date expects a date value and UI provides a calendar helper. A user input can have a default value set. The value can be hidden with asterisks, which is useful for sensitive information. For a plain value type, multiple options can be inserted. During the rendering, a user must pick one of the specified values.":[""],"This input value is fed from a specified fact for the host, which the template is being rendered for.

E.g. the example below will load the value through input called cpus.":[""],"While rendering the template in preview mode, the input either loads the value or uses a placeholder in case the input is not ready for rendering. If the template is rendered and the input is not ready, an error is thrown. The readiness criteria differs per input type, e.g. for Fact inputs linked to a host's fact with the name \\\"cpu_count\\\" , when @host contains a value for the fact, the input is ready.":[""],"As mentioned above, different template types support different template inputs.
