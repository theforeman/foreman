# In several cases we want to break chain of responsibility in MVC a bit and provide
# a safe way to access current user (and maybe few more data items). Storing it as
# a global variable (or class member) is not thread-safe. Including ThreadSession::
# UserModel in models and ThreadSession::Controller in the application controller
# allows this without any concurrent issues.
#
# Idea taken from sentinent_user rails plugin.
