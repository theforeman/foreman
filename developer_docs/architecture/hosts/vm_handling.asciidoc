This page has an overview of Host VM manipulation having current state architecture.
Serves two purposes:
1. Understanding current implementation
1. Ease refactoring


== VM attributes

We are seeing many problems:
* A lot of methods on ComputeResource are dealing with instance attributes.
* Interfaces are storing compute_attributes, but Hosts are not.
* ComputeProfile has completely independent `Hash` of attributes stored in DB.
