= Smart Proxy devel setup
:toc: right
:toclevels: 5

[[prerequisites]]
== Prerequisites
https://github.com/theforeman/smart-proxy[Smart Proxy] will run with the following requirements (aside from rubygem dependencies):

* Ruby `>= 2.7.0`

[[installation]]
== Installation

[source, bash]
....
git clone https://github.com/theforeman/smart-proxy
cd smart-proxy
cp config/settings.yml.example config/settings.yml
bundle install
....

[[configuration]]
== Configuration

By default, Smart Proxy does not listen on any port and SSL is not configured, so uncomment the `http_port` configuration value:

[source, bash]
....
# config/settings.yml
:http_port: 8080
:foreman_url: http://localhost:3000
:bind_host: ['*']
....

To elevate authorization for Foreman, either the remote IP address or DNS hostname, or both, must be in the trusted_hosts list. This depends on how your system connects to the proxy (IPv4 or IPv6) and also on how the remote IP address is reverse-resolved. The following list of trusted entries should do the trick:

[source, bash]
....
grep -A10 trusted_hosts config/settings.yml
:trusted_hosts:
- localhost
- localhost4
- localhost6
- 127.0.0.1
- ::1
- your_host_name
- your_host_name.with.full.domain.com
....

[[running-proxy]]
== Running proxy
[source, bash]
....
bundle exec bin/smart-proxy
....

[[smart-proxy-in-foreman]]
== Smart Proxy in Foreman
Add proxy in Foreman UI (_Infrastructure > Smart Proxies_)

[source, bash]
....
Name: localhost
URL: http://localhost:8080
....

[[features-and-plugins]]
== Features and plugins
Smart Proxy starts with almost no features enabled. Each feature must be individually configured. Most of the features (which are essentially build-in plugins) and external plugins (these live in separate git repositories) require some backend system configuration so this is out of scope for this guide.

Here is how you can enable a simple feature which requires no configuration or a backend system:

[source, bash]
....
cd smart-proxy
cp config/settings.d/logs.yml.example config/settings.d/logs.yml
grep :enabled config/settings.d/logs.yml
:enabled: true
....

And here is how you can enable a simple (external) plugin without a backend system:

[source, bash]
....
cd smart-proxy
grep shellhooks bundler.d/shellhooks.local.rb
gem "smart_proxy_shellhooks", path: "../smart_proxy_shellhooks/"

git clone https://github.com/theforeman/smart_proxy_shellhooks ../smart_proxy_shellhooks
cp ../smart_proxy_shellhooks/settings.d/shellhooks.yml.example \
  config/settings.d/shellhooks.yml
grep enabled config/settings.d/shellhooks.yml
:enabled: true
....

[[ssl]]
== SSL (optional)
To configure SSL, generate a CA cert, a server cert and a client cert with a common name listed in trusted hosts configuration.

Assuming the following files:

* `ca.crt` - CA cert
* `server.{crt,pem,key}` - server SSL cert
* `client-localhost.{crt,pem,key}` - client SSL cert

Then configure Foreman (via _Administer - Settings_) as follows:

* SSL CA cert: `ca.pem`
* SSL cert: `client-localhost.pem`
* SSL key: `client-localhost.key`

And configure smart-proxy as:
[source, bash]
....
grep ^:ssl config/settings.yml
:ssl_ca_file: "ca.pem"
:ssl_certificate: "server.pem"
:ssl_private_key: "server.key"

grep ^:https_port config/settings.yml
:https_port: 8443
....

Then you can add Smart Proxy in Foreman UI as `https://localhost:8443`.

[[troubleshooting]]
== Troubleshooting

`krb5` error while running `bundle install`
[source, bash]
....
Error while installing proxy:
checking for krb5.h... no
checking for -lkrb5... no
warning: com_err not found, usually a dependency for kadm5clnt
checking for kadm5/admin.h... no
*** extconf.rb failed ***
Could not create Makefile due to some reason, probably lack of necessary
libraries and/or headers.  Check the mkmf.log file for more details.  You may
need configuration options.
....

If you won\'t need Kerberos authentication, you can run:

[source, bash]
....
bundle install --without krb5
....
